****************************************

I don't know about you but I have a shit load of scripts that I have that just lie about in various states in various severs that do various things. When it comes to finding them to help me with a task it takes ages to find them or even remember I had them. So without further fanfare I introduce the '@swmcc cookbook'.

The repo is laid out in my usual disorderd fashion but as per usual it makes sense to me. It will be language/app specific by directory/folder. I might put an index here.. You never know.

Much love @swmcc
