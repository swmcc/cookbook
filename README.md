****************************************

I don't know about you but I have a shit load of scripts that I have that just lie about in various states in various severs that do various things. When it comes to finding them to help me with a task it takes ages to find them or even remember I had them. So without further fanfare I introduce the '@swmcc cookbook'.

The repo is laid out in my usual disorderd fashion but as per usual it makes sense to me. It will be language/app specific by directory/folder.

***chef***

Recipies for chef. As of October 2012 I am learning how to use chef. I will add more to here as time goes on.

***debian***

Recipies for debian. As of October 2012 there is only one file in here. This is an old file from the web1.0 that created a .deb file of an application for distribution from a suite of servers.

***perl***

Handy utility and reporting scripts that I have had over the years. I hardly ever use them anymore as actual tools have now replaced them than handcrafed scripts.

***food***

Am tired of actually having to google search for my favourite recipies and this is a cook book, so you know.. fuck it :)


Much love @swmcc
