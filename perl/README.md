DISCLAIMER: Most of these files are old as you can see from the stubs. Am just keeping them here as it doesn't hurt to look back and see how things were done 'back in the day'.

## add_site

I used this script for adding a site to my laptop dev environment.

## build_

These files are pretty old. They were very basic stub template generators for any scripts I was writing. They need a Template::Toolkit template files - but they no longer exist. I now use Thor for this sort of stuff.

## generic_report

I used to write reports like they were going out of fashion. This skeleton script provides me 
with the donkey work to be able to get into the report ASAP.

## sync_site

A basic rsync wrapper for any site that was on my laptop that I wanted synced to live. Obviously now I use capistrano or CI.
